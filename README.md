# Actionable-News-Network
Built for SI660 Project

## Instructions
Load as an unpacked Chrome extension to use.

Either follow the link through the extension icon, or go to bbc.com and find a Coronavirus article to see the extension in action.

## Notes & Limitations

- Detects page topic and only injects the html part of the extension if the topic is supported.
- Runs off of a Firebase database, but only loads for articles relating to Coronavirus right now.

## Next Steps

- Add a search mechanism for Firebase
- Remove hard coding for Coronavirus info and have the results based off current topics, and search Firebase for a match
- Create a website with more info for topics past the limited info the extension can provide (so links can go to the website with lots of additional info)
